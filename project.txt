												Corona Center Management Project.

		Requirements: 

I want this project on command line Interface. I Want its interface to be cleanly organized. Make this program to maintain record of Patients. Store Patient's data. Make & Store Doctor's Data. Make & Store Admin Data. I want a Login page at the beginning. Three users can enter. Admin, Doctor Or Patient. I want you to keep track of person by its ID No.
I want you to keep track of beds in use. And a doctor has the option to "Declare Healthy" to a patient & This Patient is removed from record & center & Free bed count is increased by 1 Number. 
Now we Talk about access Control. A patient can't modify anything. A doctor can modify a patient's status. An Admin can Modify Data of Admins, Doctors, Patients. But can't access "Declare healthy " option. In case, Someone forgets his login credentials, He or she should contact Admin Department for help. Good Luck With Your Project <3
